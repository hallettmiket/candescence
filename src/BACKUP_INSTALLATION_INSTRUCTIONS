- This is a streamlined version that uses the mmdetection platform. It should be user friednly.
- The script for creating the training data is currently not in this repository.  I'll add it shortly (please contact Van if you don't see).


## Setting up the environment and installing mmdetection


1. Create a conda virtual environment and activate it.

`conda create -n open-mmlab python=3.7 -y`
`conda activate open-mmlab`

2. Install PyTorch and torchvision,

`conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch`


3. Install mmcv-full

`pip install mmcv-full -f https://download.openmmlab.com/mmcv/dist/cu102/torch1.7.0/index.html`


4.Install build requirements and then install MMDetection.

`git clone https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection.git`
`cd mmdetection`
`pip install -r requirements/build.txt`
`pip install -v -e .`


5. Install scikit-image

`conda install -c conda-forge scikit-image`
