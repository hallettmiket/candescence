The curriculum is as follows:

(i) White, Budding White
(ii) White, Budding White, Opaque,Budding Opaque
(iii) White, Budding White, Opauqe, Budding Opaque, Gray, Budding Gray
(iii) White,Budding White, Opaque, Budding Opaque,Gray, Budding Gray, Shmoo
(iv) White, Budding White, Opaque, Budding Opaque, Gray, Budding Gray,Shmoo, Pseudohyphae, P-start, P-junction
(v) White, Budding White, Opaque, Budding Opaque, Gray, Budding Graym,Shmoo, Pseudohyphae, P-start, P-junction, Hyphae, H-start, H-junction

Artifacts and Unknowns are present in each dataset of the curriculum. 

The training data for each stage of the curriculum is located at `/home/data/refined/deep-microscopy/train-data/curriculum` where each dataset is named as the class that is being introduced at that particular stage.  For example, in stage 4 of the curriculum `Shmoo` is being introduced and the training data is located at `/home/data/refined/deep-microscopy/train-data/curriculum/white-opaque-gray-shmoo`.

To run the the curriculum run `python train.py`. Note for now that the output path has to be set to `/home/data/refined/deep-microscopy/output/curriculum/output`.  This is because at each stage of the curriculum the last saved model from the previous stage is loaded.  This is currently hard coded into the config files found in `configs`.  The gpu_ids are also hard coded in and should be changed accordingly.

As the curriculum procedes, the number of frozen layers of the feature extractor (ie, ResNet) is increased.  This is done in the respective config files for each stage.
