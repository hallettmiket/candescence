Candescence - Software to capture the essence of Candida albicans morphologies. :microscope: :crystal_ball:



This is an effort of the [Hallett lab](https://mikehallett.science). The full project is described at our [OSF Candescence](https://osf.io/qdxbp/) repository.

This project is described in our bioRxiv manuscript Bettauer et al. (2021) bioRxiv #445299.

This repository houses the code for building the Candescence object-detection/object-classification classifiers, the VAE and the GANs. 

The underlying learning set (entitled Varasana), presentations, figures, bibiography etc are available at the [OSF site](https://osf.io/qdxbp/).

The code here has several dependencies including [MMDETECTION](https://mmdetection.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
